## Learning In Public

**I'm leaving this repo public for others to see how it is built. This is not intended to be a theme or copied directly but it may be interesting if you want to "look under the hood".**

If you want a starter template for Gatsby, Contentful and Netlify check out my **MIT LICENSED** repo: https://github.com/ryanwiemer/gatsby-starter-gcn.

If you still have any questions feel free to contact me:
