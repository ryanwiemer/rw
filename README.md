## Development
For local development a `.env` file in the root directory is required. It should contain the  following properties and their corresponding values found in Contentful. Please note that these are purposefully not included in the repo and you will get an error if you try to build the site without them.  

```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=
CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_API_TOKEN=
```

**NOTE:** This repo is mostly just for me. If you are interested in a starter template for Gatsby, Contentful and Netlify checkout: https://github.com/ryanwiemer/gatsby-starter-gcn.
